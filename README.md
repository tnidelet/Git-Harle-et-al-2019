Abstract
Fermentation by microorganisms is a key step in the production of traditional food products such as bread, cheese, beer and wine. In these fermentative ecosystems, microorganisms interact in various ways, namely competition, predation, commensalism and mutualism. Traditional wine fermentation is a complex microbial process performed by Saccharomyces and non-Saccharomyces yeast species. To better understand the different interactions occurring within wine fermentation, isolated yeast cultures were compared with mixed co-cultures of one reference strain of S. cerevisiae with one strain of four non-Saccharomyces yeast species (Metschnikowia pulcherrima, M. fructicola, Hanseniaspora opuntiae and H. uvarum). In each case, we studied population dynamics, resource consumption and the production of metabolites from central carbon metabolism. This deep phenotyping of competition kinetics allowed us to identify the main mechanisms of interaction between species. S. cerevisiae competed with H. uvarum and H. opuntiae for resources although both Hanseniaspora species were characterized by a strong mortality either in isolated or mixed fermentations. M. pulcherrima and M. fructicola displayed a negative interaction with the S. cerevisiae strain tested, with a decrease in viability in co-culture, probably due to iron depletion via the production of pulcherriminic acid. Overall, this work highlights the importance of measuring cell populations and their metabolite kinetics to understand yeast-yeast interactions. These results are a first step towards ecological engineering and the rational design of optimal multi-species starter consortia using modeling tools.
